This is a project called beer_advocate_reccommender created by Clayton Blythe on 2017/04/05

Note that the compressed file in "data" must be unzipped, as it is almost 200MB uncompressed. It represents approximately 1.6 million
observations of user reviews from beeradvocate.com 

The goal of this project is to visualize beer reviews and hopefully build a recommender system with it that could be used 
for my own purposes or built into an app.
